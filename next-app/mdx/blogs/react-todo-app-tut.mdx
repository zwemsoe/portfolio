In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a todo app using create-react-app and store your todo items persistently in your browser's local storage.
This tutorial is for the peeps who are looking to get started with React. It will primarily focus on the functionality part of the app rather than styling and design.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS - version)

## Create React App

[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) is one of the easiest ways to create a React project and the [recommended way](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) by the official React team. It provides the pre-configured setup for bundling your files and a boilerplate for your project.

To get started, open up your terminal on whichever directory you prefer and run:

```bash
npx create-react-app todo-app
```

After it's done setting up, change directory into it and start up your server:

```bash
cd todo-app
npm start
```

This will start your development server on http://localhost:3000. If you see an animated React icon on the screen, you're good to go.

Now, let's explore the folder structure and some of the key files in it.

The project is structured into two main folders: `public` and `src` .
`public` contains all the assets like images, favicons, html files and etc. We won't need to concern ourselves with this folder.
`src` folder is where we put all our javascript files and write our logic.

To understand how React renders the page, we need to look at the files: `index.js` , `App.js` , and `index.html` .

nside App.js, we see the function App the returns the HTML content that is displayed on the screen.

<CodeFile children="App.js" />

```js
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Next, `index.js` takes this App function and calls or renders it inside the DOM element with an id called "root". You can file this element (which is a div) inside `index.html` file.

<CodeFile children="index.js" />

```js
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

<CodeFile children="index.html" />

```html
<body>
  <noscript>You need to enable JavaScript to run this app.</noscript>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <!--
      This HTML file is a template.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page.

      You can add webfonts, meta tags, or analytics to this file.
      The build step will place the bundled scripts into the <body> tag.

      To begin the development, run `npm start` or `yarn start`.
      To create a production bundle, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.
    -->
</body>
```

Essentially, React is taking HTML returned from App and pasting it inside that div with id="root".
